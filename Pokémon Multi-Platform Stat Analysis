-- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Pok√©mon by Total Stats
-- These are the strongest Pok√©mon based on total base stats
SELECT name, total
FROM pokemon
ORDER BY total DESC

-- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Count of Pok√©mon by Primary Type
-- See which primary types are most common
SELECT type_1, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM pokemon
GROUP BY type_1
