🗃️ SQL Projects Portfolio

This section showcases my work using SQL for data analysis, exploration, and reporting.
From writing complex queries to cleaning and joining tables, these projects demonstrate how I use SQL to extract actionable insights from structured datasets — with a focus on real-world business use cases.

🧠 Why SQL?

SQL is the foundation of data-driven decision making in virtually every industry. I use SQL because it allows me to:

🧹 Clean and shape raw data at the source – No need to export or transform externally

🧠 Ask powerful questions – Find trends, segment customers, and calculate key metrics directly in the database

📊 Feed downstream tools – Provide clean, structured outputs for use in Excel, Python, Tableau, or ML models

🏢 Work in real enterprise settings – SQL is still the most in-demand language for analysts and consultants working with structured business data

🛠️ Tools & Platforms

PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite – core SQL databases

Google BigQuery – for large-scale cloud-based SQL analysis

dbdiagram.io, ERD tools – for schema planning and documentation

Used alongside: Python, Excel, and Tableau for full-stack data projects
